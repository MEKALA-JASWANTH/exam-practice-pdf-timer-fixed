## ✨ What's Fixed in This Version

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

1. **Missing Question 11 Issue - RESOLVED** ✅
   - **Problem**: Questions were being skipped during PDF extraction (particularly Q11)
   - **Root Cause**: 
     - Overly strict regex patterns that didn't match all question formats
     - Arbitrary `break` condition that stopped extraction after 5 questions per page
   - **Solution**: 
     - Enhanced regex patterns to support multiple question numbering formats
     - Removed premature break conditions
     - Added support for "Q.1", "Q1", "Question 1", "1.", "1)" formats

2. **Improved Option Parsing** ✅
   - Better detection of A, B, C, D answer choices
   - Handles various option formats (A. , A) , A: )
   - More robust text cleaning

### 🎓 Key Improvements

- **Enhanced Question Extraction**: No more missing questions!
- **Flexible Pattern Matching**: Supports various PDF formats
- **Image Support Preparation**: Added PIL/Pillow and PyMuPDF for future image handling
- **Improved UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with question navigation
- **Timer Functionality**: Track your exam time
- **Progress Tracking**: See which questions you've answered

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Fixed Code Changes

**Before (Buggy)**:
```python
patterns = [
    r'Q\.\s*(\d+)[.:\s]+(.+?)(?=Q\.\s*\d+|\*)',
    r'(\d+)\.\s+(.+?)(?=\d+\.|$)',
]
if len(matches) > 5:  # ❌ This caused questions to be skipped!
    break
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
patterns = [
    r'Q(?:uestion)?[.:]?\s*(\d+)[.:)\s]+(.+?)(?=Q(?:uestion)?[.:]?\s*\d+|$)',
    r'(\d+)[.:)]\s+(.+?)(?=\d+[.:)\s]|$)',
]
# Removed arbitrary break - process all questions!
```
